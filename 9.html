<br><br>He applied for job in 30 different companies and got rejected by every company
<br><br>When he applied for job at KFC he was the only person out of 24 people who got rejected
<br><br>Later when he came to know that there is no online marketplace in china so he came up with the idea of Alibaba ecomerce company
<br><br>But even after starting Alibaba, he couldn't make it profitable and it was about to go bankrupt.
