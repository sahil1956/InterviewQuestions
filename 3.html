<h3>3.What are your weaknesses</h3>
<p>
<br><br>One of my weekness is i often criticize myself to do more better than whatever i do rather than focusing on what i have achived currently i am working on this weakness by finding positive outcomes from my work.I have started appreciating myself
<br><br>My another weakness is taking more work load by thinking that i can manage it.Now to handle this weakness i am have started setting the priorities of the different tasks.And i only take extra work if it is possible.
<br><br>One more weakness of mine is sometimes, I avoid asking others for help because I feel bothersome.But i have realised that in order to learn new skills and balance my workload, it's often necessary to ask for help.Now to overcome this weakness i offer to help others because that makes it easier for me to ask for help to others
