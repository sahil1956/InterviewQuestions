<h3>11.How do you handle criticism</h3>
<p>
<br><br>When someone criticizes me I try to evaluate the critic’s intention honestly
<br><br>I Assess what was the motive of critic behind the criticism if he want me to improve over my skills then i thank to him
<br><br>I apologies for my weekness
<br><br>I give assurance to critic that i will improve on my weekness pointed out by him
<br><br>Otherwise if critics motive was to demotivate me then i keep myself calm and avoid any kind of conversation
<br><br>I don't take criticism personally
<br><br>In case of negative feedback i keep myself motivated
