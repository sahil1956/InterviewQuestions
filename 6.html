<h3>6.Tell me about thing you are proudest of</h3>
<p>
<br><br>First of all, I was incredibly lucky in my life. 
<br><br>Lucky to be born in a good family and country like india, 
<br><br>I find myself lucky i am recieving education, and i am living healthy life. 
<br><br>I am well aware that most people aren’t so lucky in their lives to get all these things. 
<br><br>Therefore I prefer to be grateful for everything that I managed to achieve in my life
<br><br>Because at the end of the day I would have achieved nothing, had I not been so lucky in my life.
