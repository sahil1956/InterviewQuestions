<h3>12.What have you learned from your mistakes</h3>
<p>
<br><br>First and most important thing which i have learned is we will not be able to do any thing until we try it and i have realised this several times
<br><br>Second one is We learn more things when we do some difficult task because we go out of our comfort zone
<br><br>Third one is we should utilize our time properly because time is more important than any other thing
<br><br>Fourth one is never consider yourself superior than others because they also know the things which we don't know
<br><br>Fifth one is you we should learn from every possible source because there is always opportunity to learn
<br><br>Sixth one is small decisions lead to big outcomes therefore before taking any decision think multiple times about that
