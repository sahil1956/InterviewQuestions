<h3>16.Describe the situation where you solved difficult problem,worked under tight deadline to get a job done.</h3>
<p>
<br><br>Me and my friend we participated in one hackathon.
<br><br>When problem statements of the hackthons were announced we were very surprised because all the problem statements were based on AI/ML
<br><br>And we were not aware of AI/Ml
<br><br>So we were going to quit from that hackathon and at last moment we decided to attempt it
<br><br>we chose one problem statement
<br><br>there were 24 hours in our hand to find solution for that problem
<br><br>we went through multiple resources and tried out whatever was possible from our side and we successfully build application for that problem
<br><br>I think this is one of the situation where things were difficult to deal but i managed to handle
