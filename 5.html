<h3>5.Tell me about time you failed</h3>
<p>
<br><br>We were having a project on database managemnt system in third semester 
<br><br>It was group project and me and my group 
<br><br>We did't focus more on the project at that time
<br><br>Even we didn't make any plan plan to do that project 
<br><br>And when project submission date came there was lot of work load of other subjects and also there was less time to complete project
<br><br>And we ended up doing project with less features 
<br><br>And that affected our marks
<br><br>This is the moment where i failed 
<br><br>And I came to know the imporatance of academic projects and importance of time management from this failure
